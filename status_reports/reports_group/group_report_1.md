So far we have created a board on Trello, a github repository, established a communication channel, and a product backlog. The Trello board allows us to stay organized by tracking the tasks that we plan to work on, are currently working on, and have finished. The github repository stores all of the project related files aside from the Trello board. We are using Discord to coordinate on assignments for the group project. The product backlog lists all of the functionality that we plan to implement in the project.

Our goals for next week include: finish the flask introduction, complete both individual and team status reports, figure out an interesting way to dillineate our product from others. The flask assignment will create a foundational understanding of how the project will be created. The status reports will keep us organized and on the same page. By researching similar products, we may be able to find a way to differentiate ours in a way that improves the product. Additionally, next week we plan to figure out what tasks in the product backlog we will attempt to implement.
